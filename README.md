## Development

This section explains how to set up the project for development and how to run tests.

### Project Setup

To bootstrap the project, run the following commands from the root of the monorepo:

```sh
yarn 
yarn build
yarn symlink
```

This will install dependencies, build all packages, and create symlinks between them.


### Initialize Submodules

Before proceeding, make sure to initialize and update the submodules:

```sh
git submodule update --init --recursive
```

This command will initialize and fetch the submodules defined in the project.

### Running Tests

To run tests for a specific package, navigate to the package directory and use the `test:watch` script. For example, to run tests for `@hyperweb/build`:

```sh
cd ./packages/build
yarn test:watch
```

This command leverages Jest's watch mode, which provides a convenient interface for running tests.

### Jest Watch Mode

Jest watch mode offers several useful hotkeys to control test execution:

- `a` - Run all tests
- `f` - Run only failed tests
- `p` - Filter by a filename regex pattern
- `t` - Filter by a test name regex pattern
- `q` - Quit watch mode
- `Enter` - Trigger a test run

Here are some examples of how to use these hotkeys:

1. Press `p`, then type `utils` to run tests only in files with "utils" in their name.
2. Press `t`, then type `should calculate` to run only tests with "should calculate" in their description.
3. Press `a` to run all tests again after filtering.

These hotkeys make it easy to focus on specific tests or files during development.

### Workflow Tips

1. Keep the test runner in watch mode while you're developing. This provides instant feedback as you make changes.
2. Use the `p` and `t` filters to focus on the specific area you're working on. This can significantly speed up the test-debug cycle.
3. Remember to run all tests (`a`) before committing changes to ensure you haven't inadvertently broken anything elsewhere in the package.
